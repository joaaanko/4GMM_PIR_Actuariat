# PIR-Actuarial science

Modelling an insurance company using already established models. 

## Quick Start

This repository is a collaborative project for our PIR project on actuarial science, in which we have to simulate models 

This project is done in both Python and R.

### If you want to execute the code on your own machine *with Python*

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Next, clone this project by typing the following commands in a terminal:

    $ git clone https://github.com/joaaanko/4GMM_PIR_Actuariat.git
    $ cd 4GMM_PIR_Aactuariat

Finally, start Jupyter Notebook.

    $ jupyter notebook

### If you want to execute the code on your own machine *with R*

Install the R kernel for Jupyter. Instructions are here: [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) and here: [Rich Pauloo](https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/).

Then launch Jupyter Lab (some code cells don't render in Jupyter Notebook).
